                I see many people on the internet, and I do not like what I see.
              </p>
              <p>
                The internet, in my opinion, should be a place for people to
                interact. But people do not interact. They influence each other
                with their stupidity. Some go naked to go viral. Some say that
                they got intimidated because of a four-year-old girl seeing a
                man entering a female bathroom. “The kid gets a wrong idea about
                us,” said a stupid man who thinks he is a girl now by using
                make-up and having fake big breasts. He was so intimidated. I
                wonder.  Who did actually feel threatened? In my opinion, the
                girl must have a scary look to the point she could make a
                forty-year-old man feel threatened.
                <strong>
                  How stupid that man is. He was the one who made that little
                  girl scared, and yet he blamed her.
                </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                I also hate YouTube. I do not hate it because it has stupid ads.
                Some ads that I have seen are ridiculous. They are stupid and
                ugly. Some are fake. Ads about the game do not show real
                pictures of the game's user interface. Some even promote
                features that do not exist in the game. But those are not the
                reasons I hate YouTube because my browser can still block those
                ads.
              </p>
              <p>
                YouTube lacks consistency in enforcing its so-called
                <a
                  href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en_us/howyoutubeworks/policies/community-guidelines/"
                >
                  Community Guidelines</a
                >. It allows stupid videos as long as the channel is monetized.
                This is what I hate about YouTube. It allows scumbags like
                <a
                  href="https://yewtu.be/search?q=just+andrew+tate+admitting+his+crime"

                  Andrew Tate</a
                >
                to exist. He is a pimp. He is a criminal. Yet YouTube is okay
                with him.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hate videos that do not show respect for women. Some women are
                making videos showing their bodies for the sake of views. Some
                even do orgasm. Those women have lost their minds. Now is the
                time when stupidities get normalized.
              </p>
              <p>
                I can keep going on listing the stupidity of idiot people on
                YouTube. But I do not have time for that.
              </p>

                What do you think about the news? Fake news media exist. You can
                not believe everything you read on the news media. But you can
                not be deceived easily if you have knowledge. If you use your
                brain, you will have a defense against fake news. Do you want an
                example? There is a video
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQEy82pzc_A"
                  >showing Elon Musk balancing two spoons</a
                >
                and the stupid reporter asked a very stupid question, “Does this
                video prove that Elon Musk was high in front of President
                Trump?” If you ask yourself, how come a man who was losing
                balance could balance two spoons with his little finger? Can you
                believe in such garbage? I do not think so.
              </p>
              <p>
                Forget about that garbage. Let us discuss personal websites or
                indie web.
              </p>
              <p>
                Personal websites are the best place to know a person even
                deeper. I believe everything about the website, starting from
                the look to the content, reflects the identity of the owner. If
                a person loves simplicity, this person keeps the layout of the
                website simple. An expressive person may use lots of emojis in
                their writing—but that is not always the case, right? I am aware
                that the internet can be a place for fake people too. People can
                use ChatGPT to generate content. They become too lazy to even
                type. In the old days, people act differently on the internet.
                They may have a cool username. But when I meet them, they are
                not that spectacular. In the end, the true nature of a person
                can not be seen easily just based on the person’s personal
                website.

                Let me tell you this. I am nobody. I am not a king for sure. I
                am not rich. I am Gallant Servant. I chose that name because I
                want to serve people with a lot of great knowledge. I love
                writing and helping people. Having this website helps me do what
                I love. In case you do not know “gallant,” it means brave or
                bold. I want to share knowledge with strong language. I also
                want to face the world of this wicked internet with boldness.
                But I do not want to be cocky. As a result, I decided to become
                a brave servant. I want to be humble because I am a Christian.
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope you get a general idea about who I am. I do not introduce
                myself like most people do. I imagine myself giving a speech in
                front of people. If you are interested in me, feel free to
                contact me. Don't be shy. I will not bite you—heck I can not
                even bite you anyway.
